This application is a team profile builder. The user will run the program and be asked a series of questions on who will be the manager of the team. The user will then be asked whether they would like to add an engineer or an intern. Once the user chooses intern or manager, another series of questions will follow. The user can then add as many interns and engineers as they would like. Once the user chooses that they would no longer like to add more employees, the information provided for each added employee will be dynamically updated to the team.html file.
